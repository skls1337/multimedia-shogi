        <h1 class="uvod">Shogi - Japanese chess</h1>
    <p>Shogi or Japanese chess is<b>&nbsp;a traditional logical and strategy chess-like game from Japan</b>. Even non-chess players find out that Japanese chess is fun and many people&nbsp;<b>who don't like chess, love to play shogi!</b></p>
    <p>Shogi is <strong>very famous in its native homeland of Japan</strong>, where it has a very rich tradition and history.</p>
    <p>The biggest difference from classic chess is that&nbsp;<b>all captured opponent's pieces can be returned back to the game as your own on any empty square.</b>&nbsp;Another difference is that most of the pieces can be <b>upgraded&nbsp;</b>when they reach the promotion zone (the last 3 rows). In Shogi there are almost&nbsp;<b>no tie games</b>.</p>
