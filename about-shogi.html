    <p>Shogi is similar to the classic game of chess, but has interesting changes and addition to the rules. The main change is the re-entry of captured pieces (“drop rule”), which makes the game more engaging and makes unexpected turnover possible. Another addition is the promotion of all pieces. The pieces become stronger, and make the game more interesting (Explained further in <a href="http://www.shogi.cz/en/rules">the rules</a>). New players who have never played chess before can become proficient within two or three games, thanks to our special marking. An experienced chess player can learn even sooner. It is truly a great game for professionals who are looking for a challenge as well as for beginners.</p>

    <h2><b>Shogi History</b></h2>
    <p>The exact origin of Shogi is unknown, but it most likely evolved from Chinese chess when it was delivered by the imperial ambassador during the rule of Nara (710-794). It became popular with Japanese nobility in the Heian period (794 - 1185) when the Japanese capital moved from Nara to Kyoto.</p>
   <p>The origin of the re-entry of captured playing pieces is not known, but it was probably introduced in the 16th century. At that time, captured soldiers had two options, execution or enter a battle for the enemy.</p>
    <p>The modern shogi was developed from a version of Sho-shogi (Small shogi). The rules were officially established and precisely formulated at the beginning of the Edo period (1600-1868; Edo is the former name of Tokyo).</p>
